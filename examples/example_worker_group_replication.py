"""
Cribl Worker Group Replication Example

This example demonstrates how to programmatically replicate an existing 
Worker Group configuration using the Control Plane SDK.

This example performs the following operations:

1. Retrieves a list of all Worker Groups in Cribl Stream.
2. Selects the first Worker Group in the list as the source Worker Group 
to replicate.
3. Retrieves the complete configuration of the source Worker Group.
4. Creates a new Worker Group that uses the same configuration as the source 
Worker Group. The replica Worker Group has a unique ID and a name and 
description that identify it as a replica.

Data flow: Source Worker Group → Configuration Extraction → New Worker Group Creation

Prerequisites:
- An .env file configured with your authentication credentials.
- At least one existing Worker Group in Cribl Stream.
- API Bearer token with Permissions that include creating Worker Groups.
